## Ortiz Pablo Dinamic "Team" Page

This simple website shows the vast and complete team in charge of fully developing the final integrated project for the winter semester where the integrated brands were Peroni Beer and Tilex disinfectant cleaner; resulting in Tilex beer with Mouthwash.
The greatest challenge from the creative point of view was to find the middle point between 2 such different brands and from there it was defined to revolutionize the world of alcoholic beverages with a new one that, in addition to being fun and showing a lifestyle full of fun and friendship, takes care of the oral health of those who consume it under the premise that a good life deserves a smile.
